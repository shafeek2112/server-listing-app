# Frontend Application - Angular

This folder contains the Angular frontend application for the server filtering project.

## Requirements

- Node.js (preferably the latest LTS version)
- Angular CLI (^16.0.0)

## Installation

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
2. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.

## Development

For the development build, run `ng serve` or `ng build` and update the backend API endpoint in the `src/environments/environment.development.ts` file.

## Production

For the production build, run `ng serve --configuration=production` or `ng build --configuration=production` and update the backend API endpoint in the `src/environments/environment.production.ts` file.

## Running Test Cases

To run the test cases, execute the following command:

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
